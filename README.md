## **Part 1: Aims of project**
### **Background of this project**
 People nowadays often fail to plan on their own financial status which undermines many aftermaths in various aspects, say interpersonal relationship within family and qualiy of life. It is pravalent to see people are broke due to some reasons in newspaper, like uncontrolled leisure expenditure. 
 Undenibly, managing financial status is an essential skill for all of us. And various researches have shown that it is beneficial to develop good habit since early stage. However, parents lack experience and tools. In light of this, we would like to develop an accounting system to help parents to inculcate their kids the concept of currency as well as helping teens to develop a healthy financial habit in daily life. This system provides a bunch of user-friendly features to view, manage and track their kids' financial status. Hopefully, we would like to promote good econ-planning our next generation in long term, contributing to the society through this app. 
 
### **Why the project is useful**  
 In the Account system, basic functions will be included. Add/delete/modify the data and generating report for parents and kids to track their financial status. Children and parents can view financial status conveniently. It is more efficient and precies through digital tools. Also, good-planning for very important. "If you fail to plan, you plan to fail". There will be statics and pattern-prediction return bact to the Users. Eventually, they can get our quality analysis in order to understand their financial status and patterns well in recitfying their normal financial behaviour. Moreover, security for this system is very important part since financial status is very sensitive personal information. We would like to have high enough security level. Last but not least, interactivity between kids and parent is also crucial. Parents can reward their kids throught the app. Thus parents can educate their children how to manage their pocket money. While kids can learn the concept of currency at the early stage. 

### **How users can get started with the project**
  You can start with input your daily information
  Then follow our lists of commands.
  Unreasonable inputs will ask for reconfirmation
  You can follow our commands to show graphs and patterns
  - e.g
   - You can type "mypatterns" to get use of our deep learning algorithms for getting their predicted patterns. So, you can decide the next few days better in financially speaking.

In-code documentation*
## **Part 2: Feature**
  //exclude functionailty and describe the code.
  1. Structure of information
    - fixed cost
      1. Food
      2. transportation
      3. insurance
      4. daily neccesities
      5. grocery
      6. salary
    - variable cost
      1. Stock Market
      2. Gambling
      5. Bonus
  2. Accessibility of record (delete/read)
    - A list of table showing different type of imformations per day.
    //photo here
    - Freely access by typing different commands,say Add "day" "information type" "amount" / Del "day" "information type" "amount"
    - recovery per week or back up 
    - double comfimation will be appeared if unreasonable input is given.
  3. Data manipulation/sorting algorithm
    - A struct encompassed with **2.1 _"Structure of information"_** will be declared.
    - *Vector <struct>* will be used
    - sorting by chronogical / alphabetic / numeric orders
    - query for conveniency 
      - eg. search by time. 
  4. Generate a *Report* to reader
    - An excel-like monthly report will be given to the user
    - Statistic graphs will be given 
      - eg. bar chart, line chart and pie chart 
    // **GRAPH**
  5. Alert system
    - Users can set alarm as the maximum of their spenditure monthly.
    - Alarm music will be installed
## **Part 3: Additional feature**
  1. security
    - using cipher transposition
    - login system with checking 
       - eg. absence check, format check ( for email, xxx@xxx.com), more-secured password (Case sensitvie, special characters and number mixing alpabet)
       - alert for invalid input
  2. Deep learning
    - Backward propagation (ReLU,sigmoid,softmax)
  3. Rewarding system
     - Parents can award their kids through this system, like giving pocket money, bonus if they finish homework or housework. 

## **Part 4: Limitations**
 1. Only standard library is allowed. Thus the system maybe not very powerful. 
 2. As year 1 students, we only have limited knowledge. However, we would try our best to finish it.
