## **Part 1: Aims of project**
### **What the project does**
 Nowadays, many people lose to have a plan on their own financial status which undermines many aftermaths in various aspects, say interpersonal relationship within family and qualiy of life. In regarding this phenomenon, we would like to promote econ-planing inside our society, therefore we would like to start this project. This project can give them a reference and inspirations on how to manipulate themselves better in a long term. 
### **Why the project is useful**  
 Magnaing financial status is an essential skill for all of us. Children and teens should develop such habbit since early age. However, parents lack experience and tools. Thus, we would like to develop an accounting system to help parents to educate their kids the concept of currency as well as helping teens to develop a healthy financial habit in daily life. 
 In the Account system, basic functions will be included. Add/delete/modify the data and generating report for parents and kids to track their fancial status. Also, good-planning for very important. "If you fail to plan, you plan to fail". There will be statics and pattern-prediction return bact to the  Users. Eventually, they can get our quality analysis in order to understand their financial status and patterns well in recitfying their normal financial behaviour.Thus, Moreover, security for this system is very important part since financial status is very sensitive personal information. We would like to have high enough security level. Last but not least, interactivity between kids and parents can be crucial. Parents can reward their kids throught the app. 

### **How users can get started with the project**
  They can start with input .....
  Then ...
  Unreasonable...
  
  Then, they can type "mypatterns" to get use of our deep learning algorithms for getting their predicted patterns. So, they can decide the next few days better in financially speaking.

## **Part 2: Feature**
  //exclude functionailty and describe the code.
  1. Structure of information
    - fixed cost
      1. Food
      2. transportation
      3. insurance
      4. daily neccesities
      5. grocery
      6. salary
    - variable cost
      1. Stock Market
      2. Gambling
      5. Bonus
  2. Accessibility of record (delete/read)
    - A list of table showing different type of imformations per day.
    //photo here
    - Freely access by typing different commands,say Add "day" "information type" "amount" / Del "day" "information type" "amount"
    - recovery per week or back up 
    - double comfimation will be appeared if unreasonable input is given.
  3. Data manipulation/sorting algorithm
    - A struct encompassed with **2.1 _"Structure of information"_** will be declared.
    - *Vector <struct>* will be used
    - sorting by chronogical / alphabetic / numeric orders
    - query for conveniency 
      - eg. search by time. 
  4. Generate a *Report* to reader
    - An excel-like monthly report will be given to the user
    - Statistic graphs will be given 
      - eg. bar chart, line chart and pie chart 
    // **GRAPH**
  5. Alert system
    - Users can set alarm as the maximum of their spenditure monthly.
    - Alarm music will be installed
## **Part 3: Additional feature**
  1. security
    - using cipher transposition
    - login system with checking 
       - eg. absence check, format check ( for email, xxx@xxx.com), more-secured password (Case sensitvie, special characters and number mixing alpabet)
       - alert for invalid input
  2. Deep learning
    - Backward propagation (ReLU,sigmoid,softmax)
